# SliTaz APKBUILD packages recipes

Due to the small number of interested developers, it has become difficult to update the SliTaz distribution.
As an experiment, I (Lexeii) decided to try to build a SliTaz distribution based on packages from another distribution.

Alpine Linux distribution was selected.
It uses packages in `*.apk` (Alpine Package Keeper) format.
Packages are compiled using Musl.

This repository contains additional packages that are not available in Alpine, and which were ported from SliTaz.

## What now?

  * To learn `apk-tools`.
  * Make more random ports.


## What next?

  * To port all the packages required to make regular SliTaz ISO image.
  * Make the ISO image.
  * Test it.

## Warning

This is not an official SliTaz distribution.
This is only an experiment that continues SliTaz Next, which was failed due to the inability to update the toolchain â˜¹
